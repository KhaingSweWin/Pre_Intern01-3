        <h2 id="city1">Yangon </h2>
        <p>Yangon (pronunciation [jàɰ̃ɡòʊɰ̃ mjo̰], lit. 'End of Strife'), also known as Rangoon, is the capital of the Yangon Region and the largest city of Myanmar (also known as Burma). Yangon served as the capital of Myanmar until 2006, when the military government relocated the administrative functions to the purpose-built city of Naypyidaw [nèpjìdɔ̀] in central Myanmar.[3] With over 5 million people, Yangon is Myanmar's most populous city and its most important commercial centre.

            Yangon boasts the largest number of colonial-era buildings in Southeast Asia,[4] and has a unique colonial-era urban core that is remarkably intact.[5] The colonial-era commercial core is centered around the Sule Pagoda, which is reputed to be over 2,000 years old.[6] The city is also home to the gilded Shwedagon Pagoda – Myanmar's most sacred Buddhist pagoda.
            
            Yangon suffers from deeply inadequate infrastructure, especially compared to other major cities in Southeast Asia. Though many historic residential and commercial buildings have been renovated throughout central Yangon, most satellite towns that ring the city continue to be profoundly impoverished and lack basic infrastructure.[7]</p>
        <h2 id="city2">Mandalay </h2>
        Mandalay (/ˌmændəˈleɪ/ or /ˈmændəleɪ/; Burmese: မန္တလေး; MLCTS: manta.le: [máɰ̃dəlé]) is the second-largest city in Myanmar, after Yangon. Located on the east bank of the Irrawaddy River, 716 km (445 mi) north of Yangon, the city has a population of 1,225,553 (2014 census).

Mandalay was founded in 1857 by King Mindon, replacing Amarapura as the new royal capital of the Konbaung dynasty. It was Burma's final royal capital before the kingdom's annexation by the British Empire in 1885. Under British rule, Mandalay remained commercially and culturally important despite the rise of Yangon, the new capital of British Burma. The city suffered extensive destruction during the Japanese conquest of Burma in the Second World War. In 1948, Mandalay became part of the newly independent Union of Burma.

Today, Mandalay is the economic centre of Upper Myanmar and considered the centre of Burmese culture. A continuing influx of Chinese immigrants, mostly from Yunnan, in the past 20 years, has reshaped the city's ethnic makeup and increased commerce with China.[4][5] Despite Naypyidaw's recent rise, Mandalay remains Upper Burma's main commercial, educational and health center.
        <h2 id="city3">Taunggyi </h2>
        Taunggyi (Burmese: တောင်ကြီးမြို့; MLCTS: taung kri: mrui. [tàʊɰ̃dʑí mjo̰]; Shan: ဝဵင်းတူၼ်ႈတီး [wéŋ tɔ̀ŋ kjí]) is the capital and largest city of Shan State, Myanmar (Burma) and lies on the Thazi-Kyaingtong road at an elevation of 4,712 feet, just north of Shwenyaung and Inle Lake within the Myelat region.[2] Taunggyi is the fifth largest city of Myanmar,[3] and has an estimated population of 380,665 as of 2014.[4]The city is famous for its hot air balloon festival held annually on the full moon day of Tazaungmon.[5]
